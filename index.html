    <h3>Why I Joined Programming Class</h3>
      <p>I joined the programming class because I have a passion in IT and coding in general. When I was in the University I received more of theory work and had to teach myself some practical work using Youtube for my project. I hope to learn more of the practical work here and be a developer in the future. I know Moringa school can help me do that since accoding to me and what I have read about Moringa you are more into practice and this first week has shown me exactly that.</p>
